# Licence

I decided to put the scrips under following licence:

<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/deed.en_US"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/3.0/80x15.png" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/deed.en_US">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported License</a>.

It is ok, when you use these scripts within your work or on customer site, but please do not sell them! Or integrate them into one of your products!
